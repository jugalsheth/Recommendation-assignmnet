# Movie Recommendor

We love to indulge ourselves in Netflix, prime videos, HBO max, Disney +, all of them have one thing in common: a superior recommendation system coupled with a great search functionality and that is the reason humans are hooked on to quality shows for days together

# Purpose

I wanted to create a basic recommendation system in python

# Approach

Usage of the aggregation, correlation and user data has culminated in a good recommendation system for a pre known data

- Joined the user review and movie data
- Performed Exploratory data analysis to understand the clusters of higher ratings and number od users who voted for the movies
- Pivoted a dataframe to get the title of the movies, the user ids and the ratings these users gave to each movie
- WIth the help of corrwith() we found the titles having correlation to the columns specified
